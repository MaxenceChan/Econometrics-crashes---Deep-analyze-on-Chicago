# What Causes Injuries in Chicago Car Crashes? An Econometric Study
This project analyzes traffic crashes in Chicago using econometric methods to understand the factors that increase the likelihood of injuries during an accident.
Using the official Traffic Crashes dataset from the City of Chicago, we estimate a Linear Probability Model (LPM) to measure how crash characteristics (time of day, weather, speed, location, crash type, etc.) affect the probability that at least one person is injured.

## 🎯 Objective

Model the probability of injuries occurring during a traffic crash using explanatory variables describing conditions of the crash (location, time, environment, etc.).

## 🏷️ Reference Categories (Baseline)

For each qualitative variable group, categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  
Therefore, the reference category is the one **not included in the regression**.

| Variable group | Dummies included in model | Reference (baseline) |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Time of crash  | crash_afternoon, crash_evening, crash_night | **crash_morning** |
| Holiday        | crash_christmas          | **Not Christmas** |
| Location       | location_south, location_north | **location_center** |
| Speed          | speed_below30, speed_above30 | **speed_eq30** |
| Weather        | weather_condition        | **Other weather conditions** |
| Traffic control| traffic_control          | **No traffic control** |
| Daylight       | daylight                 | **Not daylight (night/twilight)** |
| Road surface   | dry_road                 | **Not dry** |
| Damage         | damage_over_1500         | **Damage ≤ $1500** |
| Crash type     | ib8.first_crash_type_num | **Type 8 — PARKED MOTOR VEHICLE** |

## 🔎 Multicollinearity — VIF

✅ No major multicollinearity concern (VIF < 10 generally acceptable).

## 📈 Heteroskedasticity — Breusch–Pagan Test

```

**Result:** p-value ≈ 0.000 → Reject H0 → **Heteroskedasticity detected**

→ Standard errors need correction.

---

## ✅ Robust LPM

Robust estimation to correct standard errors:

```
reg injuries \
    num_units crash_christmas crash_night crash_afternoon crash_evening \
    location_south location_north \
    speed_below30 speed_above30 \
    weather_condition traffic_control daylight dry_road damage_over_1500 \
    ib8.first_crash_type_num , robust
```

### ✅ Interpretation (selected coefficients)

* **num_units ≈ +0.103** → More vehicles → higher injury probability
* **speed_below30 ≈ −0.032** → Low speed reduces injury probability
* **speed_above30 ≈ +0.030** → High speed increases injury probability
* **damage_over_1500 ≈ +0.073** → Major damage → higher injury probability
* **first_crash_type_num (9) ≈ +0.69** → Crash type greatly increases injury likelihood

## 🧾 Summary

| Step                        | Status      |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| LPM estimated               | ✅           |
| VIF checked                 | ✅ No issue  |
| Heteroskedasticity detected | ⚠️ Yes      |
| Robust SE applied           | ✅ Corrected |

## ✅ Conclusion

Even though the linear probability model has limitations, results are consistent with intuition:

* crash severity, vehicles involved, and speed conditions significantly increase the likelihood of injuries.
* Robust errors ensure valid inference under heteroskedasticity.

Further work:

* Consider non-linear models (Probit/Logit)
* Explore endogeneity & IV strategies
* Analyze spatial patterns
